# Machine Learning Project

The following is a machine learning project using methods learned in the Machine Learning course led by Assad Sayeed at the University of Gothenburg

## Problem
I will try to do x using y

## Data
The data I will use is a dataset consisting of x that I retrieved from y

## Preprocessing
To preprocess the data I have used x.

## Model
The model I have chosen is trained using an x neural network where each tensor is a vector consisting of y that represents z

## Training

## Testing

## Evaluating

## Conclusion

## Further Research
